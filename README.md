This server software was made for use in a multiplayer game I made in one of my game development courses in college.
It is not currently up-to-date, but gives an idea of how to follow the client-server architecture pattern in game
development.

The tutorial series I followed to make this can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXkn83W0QkfnqsK8I0RAz5AbUxfg3bOQ5). It was created by the user
